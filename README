======================
Simple Image Slideshow
======================

HTML Slideshow, requires just three files:

- image.txt

 This file is a list of the images to include.  One image per file. After the image URL is a caption for the image which is seperated by a pipe (|).

- viewer.php

 This is the file to load in the browser. It can be renamed to anything such as index.php.  The HTML can be modified to any preference.

- core.php

 This file doesn't need to be changed.  It just includes the logic for everything.
